               <p id="quotetext">Harlem was like a great magnet for the Negro intellectual, pulling him from everywhere. 
                Or perhaps the magnet was New York City,  and Harlem was the lodestone. Or perhaps the attraction was the great 
                flowering of Negro art and literature in the streets of Harlem and its smoky nightclubs, and the crowded rooms of dirty houses. 
                Or perhaps it was the spirit of the times, like the spirit of youth in all ages, that no one can understand but those who belong to it, 
                that made Harlem a magnet for Negroes of the twentiesâ€”like Paris in the days of Gertrude Stein." - Langston Hughes, "The Big Sea"
